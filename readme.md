# La morra

 "la morra" is a traditional southern italian game, to my knowledge still alive in Basilicata and Sardegna. 

The rules are straight-forward, and the game is free as in it requires only a hand and voice. Well, usually some wine helps. 

## Rules

Two players throw a number from 1 to 5 with their hand, at the same time. They also pronounce - as in scream - a number, trying to guess the sum of the numbers thrown by the two of them. 
The player who guesses the sum, gets a point. If nobody guesses the same, repeat. If they both guess, repeat, nobody gets a point. 

If it is a team game, the winner of each point goes on playing against the following opponents from the opposing team, until he loses. Usually, in a team game, each team forms a row opposing each other. 

How many points to win a game? You can decide. 

### Development Plan 

1. Make the logic and the game functional. 
    1.1 add extra options: as in "play random" to play a random number instead of picking.
2. Host it and make it possible for people to play it. 
3. Add crypto functionality, to allow win and loss of the in-game cryptos. 
    3.1 check the laws behind this. 
4. Add statements and offenses when winning a point, possibly in rhyme, per dialect and language.
5. Add a GUI, showing, the hands playing in real time.
6. Add voice-over of numbers and offenses.
